# vacation-Queries
## Designed by Arthur Byamukama
  - It a website that asks users questions and assigns them suitable vacation types.
  - It does this by asking a user multiple questions and weighing them
  - The user input is processed with using functions linked to jQuery
  - The user is then redirected to the suitable vacation type like either snow boarding or a beach vacation.
  - The website can be accessed on my github page [here](https://github.com/Arthur-Byamukama)
